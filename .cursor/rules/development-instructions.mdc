## Documentation First Approach


### Always Read Documentation

- **READ all documentation** before starting work on any component
- **LOCATE and READ any README.md or other .md files** in directories you're working with
- Directory-level documentation takes precedence over project
-level documentation when conflicts exist
- If documentation is unclear or outdated, seek clarification from senior team members before proceeding



### Always Update Documentation
- **UPDATE documentation when making ANY changes** to code or configuration
- Documentation updates should be committed in the same PR as code changes
- When adding new features, include clear usage examples in documentation
- Add inline comments for complex code segments
- Update API documentation when changing interfaces


### Documentation Quality Standards
- Documentation should be clear, concise, and comprehensive
- Include purpose, usage examples, and known limitations
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- For user-facing features, include screenshots or diagrams when helpful
- Document all configuration options and environment variables
