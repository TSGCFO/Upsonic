## Code Standards

### General Principles

- Write readable, maintainable code over clever solutions
- Follow the principle of least surprise
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Limit function/method length to 50 lines where possible
- Comment \"why\", not \"what\" (the code should explain what it does)

### Version Control

- Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- Commit message format: `[Type]: Brief description of change` 
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable
- Keep pull requests focused on a single concern
- Rebase feature branches before requesting review
